Consider the following CSV file "Concrete_Data.csv". This file contains the results of compressive tests for various types of concrete.

1. Load the CSV data into a pandas data frame. Print some high-level statistical info about the data frame's columns.

2. How many rows have a compressive strength > 40 MPa?

3. Plot the histogram of Coarse Aggregate and Fine Aggregate values

4. Make a plot comparing compressive strength to age

5. Make a plot comparing compressive strength to age for only those rows with < 750 fine aggregate.

6. Try to build a linear model that predicts compressive strength given the other available fields.

7. Generate predictions for all the observations and a scatterplot comparing the predicted compressive strengths to the actual values.

You should submit two UNCOMPRESSED files: 1) a Jupyter notebook in word or in a pdf file where you answer the above questions and report on your simulations, and 2) the Python code file as an independent file (.py).

From your Jupyter notebook, you can download the two files selecting: File --> Download as: 1) (select HTML or PDF) and 2) Python (.py). 

If you want to improve your homework, you can resubmit it until the deadline.
